#### Valerie Thomas – [Confessions of a Social Engineer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V-ban5EDYI)

Social engineers use a dangerous combination of technology and old fashioned con artistry to infiltrate organizations every day. In this talk we'll walk through the social engineering process including research, target selection, attack selection, and attack execution. Learn to see the world through the eyes of a social engineer and prevent yourself from being a victim.


#### Evan Czaplicki – [On Storytelling](https://www.deconstructconf.com/2017/evan-czaplicki-on-storytelling)

Hello. I am Evan Czaplicki. I designed this programming language called Elm. And according to the website, it's a delightful language for reliable web apps. And I work at this company called NoRedInk, which is, as far as we know, the biggest Elm user. So they've got about 100,000 lines of Elm running. Any new code will be written in Elm. And in the year and a half they've been using in production, still no runtime errors. So that's pretty neat. 


#### Julia Evans – [Build Impossible Programs](https://www.deconstructconf.com/2018/julia-evans-build-impossible-programs)

All right. I'm Julia, and this talk is called Build Impossible Programs. So this is about a program that I built that I really wasn't sure was going to work when I started building on it. It's a Ruby profiler. So something that is important to understand about me for this talk is that I really love debugging and profiling tools. I've written a lot of zines, which are like, hello, did you know that you can use strace to figure out what system calls your programs are using? What about TCPDUMP? Oh my goodness! So I'm kind of obsessed with tools that can tell you what your programs are doing. 


#### Miro Cupak – [How we've made a global search engine for genetic data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENV80bIbMHE)

The sensitive nature of genetic data causes a major concern in genetics - a lot of life-saving information, despite having been collected, is inaccessible. Data discovery and sharing has long been believed to be the key making new breakthroughs. In this session, we tell the story of the Beacon Network, the largest search and discovery engine of human genetic data in the world. The system is a result of years of collaboration between developers, researchers and scientists on a global scale, and the flagship project of the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health, a coalition of over 500 institutions focused on standardizing sharing of genetic data.


#### John Green – [The Nerd's Guide To Everything Online](https://www.ted.com/talks/john_green_the_nerd_s_guide_to_learning_everything_online/transcript)

So I was a really terrible student when I was a kid. My GPA was consistently in the low 2s. And I think the reason that I was such a terrible student is that I felt like education was just a series of hurdles that had been erected before me, and I had to jump over in order to achieve adulthood. And I didn't really want to jump over these hurdles, because they seemed completely arbitrary, so I often wouldn't, and then people would threaten me, you know, they'd threaten me with this "going on [my] permanent record," or "You'll never get a good job." I didn't want a good job! As far as I could tell at eleven or twelve years old, like, people with good jobs woke up very early in the morning,


#### Kathy Sierra – [Making Badass Developers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKTxC9pl-WM)

From Fluent 2015. "Every moment of every day there’s a new language, framework, format, protocol to learn. Nobody has a more dynamic skill set than a web developer. We’ll look at the one metaskill to rule them all: The ability to come up to speed and stay there, over and over again.
